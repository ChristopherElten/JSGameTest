JavaScript First Game....

Controls

w/Up Arrow - move player up one cell
s/Down Arrow - move player down one cell
Space-Bar - Fire Shot (can be held)

Hero is placed on the left.
Enemies come from the right.
Enemies destroy barriers over time.
Shoot enemies before they get to your barriers.
After 'x' (value calculated based on level)  number of enemies are destroyed, the next level is started.

If a number of enemies get to the left side, you lose and the game restarts.

Each level increment adds more rows enemies can spawn on, as well as increases the rate they spawn. It also adds a number of columns to make the game more playable (less difficult, possible to win).
